## Why rf-download

You might have requirement to download something programmatically.

[downloadjs](https://github.com/rndme/download) is a good library, but the imperative API seems not the best friend of `react.js`. That's why you are here.

## Installation

### yarn

```bash
yarn add rf-download
```

### npm

```bash
npm install rf-download
```

## Usage

<Playground>
  <RfDownload
    url="https://leftstick.github.io/rf-download/public/example.txt"
    responseType="blob"
    fileName="test.txt"
    fileMIMEType="text/plain"
  >
    <button>Try here</button>
  </RfDownload>
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable of={RfDownload} />
